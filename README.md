## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have a recent LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** or **yarn:** Node Package Manager (npm) comes bundled with Node.js. You can also use yarn if you prefer ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)).
* **Docker** (Optional): If you intend to run the application using Docker, ensure you have Docker installed on your system ([https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:** If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Jonathank/Patient-management.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Jonathank/Patient-management.git)
    cd Patient-management
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command using either npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you might need to configure some environment variables. These are typically stored in a `.env` file in the root of your project.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** If a `.env` file doesn't already exist, create one in the root directory of the project.

2.  **Define environment variables:** Open the `.env` file and add the necessary configuration variables. This might include:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    # Add any other configuration variables your application needs
    ```

    **Note:** Refer to your application's code or any specific configuration documentation for the exact environment variables required.

## Running the Application
